This project was initially intended to improve the team coordination between me and Mr. Rodriguez!

For now it is developed by me alone and is a distraction from my work.

The game is going to be a console application challenging users to play a tic-tac-toe game, nothing more and nothing less.

Don't expect to find revolutionary algorithms or design patterns, this project is developed for fun.
